https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py â€“- graphics package used to animate. Save as python script in same directory as MST scripts to run locally.

Examples:
  $primlist.py -input Real-50-100.txt -animation True
  $prims2.py -input Int-40-80.txt -animation True
  $kruskal.py -input Real-500-1000.txt -animation False
